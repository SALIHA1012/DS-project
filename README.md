**Predicting the Best Next Move in Tic-Tac-Toe – Using Machine Learning
**
**Overview**
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model that predicts the optimal next move in a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The goal is to provide real-time suggestions for players to win or block their opponent using data-driven decisions.

**Problem Statement**
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with ‘X’ or ‘O’ to form a straight line. While the game has predefined rules, determining the best move at each turn can involve multiple decision paths. This project aims to automate decision-making in the game using machine learning.

**Dataset**
Source: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

**Features:** 
Each board state is represented as a 9-element array, where:
1 represents Player X’s move
-1 represents Player O’s move
0 represents an empty space

Target Variable: A binary classification indicating whether the suggested move is optimal:
-True: The move is the best choice.
-False: The move is not optimal.

**Board Representation (Feature Mapping)**
Each board state is represented using the following features:

TL : Top-left (Cell 1)  
TM : Top-middle (Cell 2)  
TR : Top-right (Cell 3)  
ML : Middle-left (Cell 4)  
MM : Middle-middle (Cell 5)  
MR : Middle-right (Cell 6)  
BL : Bottom-left (Cell 7)  
BM : Bottom-middle (Cell 8)  
BR : Bottom-right (Cell 9)  

**Algorithms Used**
We experimented with multiple classification algorithms to determine the best next move:

-Logistic Regression: A simple linear model for classification.
-Decision Tree: Splits board states into decision nodes for optimal move selection.
-Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Predicts the next move based on similar board states in the dataset.
-Support Vector Machine (SVM): Finds a hyperplane to distinguish optimal moves.
-AdaBoost & Gradient Boosting: Ensemble learning methods to improve weak learners.
-XGBoost: A powerful boosting method that performed best in our experiments.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**
We applied GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters such as:
-Learning rate
-Tree depth
-Number of neighbors (for KNN)
-Number of estimators (for ensemble models)

**Final Model Selection**
After evaluating multiple models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was selected as the final model due to:
-High accuracy in predicting the best next move.
-Efficiency in handling classification problems with structured board states.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
-Visualized board state distributions.
-Analyzed feature importance.
-Checked dataset balance to avoid model bias.

**Relevance and Use Cases**
-Improving Game Strategy: Helps players make better strategic decisions by predicting optimal moves.
-Game Theory Application: Demonstrates key game theory concepts like anticipating opponent moves.
-Data-Driven Decision Making: Shows how data analysis can improve strategy and decision-making.
-Pattern Recognition: Helps in recognizing gameplay patterns, useful in AI research and strategic planning.
-Educational Value: Encourages logic and critical thinking by teaching players to evaluate scenarios and make optimal choices.

**Technologies Used**
-Python
-Scikit-learn
-XGBoost & Random Forest
-Pandas & NumPy (Data processing)
-Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

**Future Enhancements**
-Implement Reinforcement Learning: Use Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn game strategies.
-Develop a GUI-Based Game: Create an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI assistance.
-Expand the Dataset: Include human gameplay data for better training.
-Deploy as a Web or Mobile App: Make the AI assistant accessible online.
